# Charged-Particle-Mirroring-
The theory of magnetic mirroring is well established. However, the finer details can only be understood when we simulate this phenomena and estimate all the quantities mentioned in the theory. This work simulates the trajectory of a charged particle under the effect of magnetic field produced by circular rings. With the right set of input, it's possible to visualize a scaled version of particle mirroring, similar to the phenomena of electron mirroring due to Earth's dipole fields. Sufficient information is available to estimate the various parameters (magnetic moment, dB/dZ etc) mentioned in the theory.
