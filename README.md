# Charged-Particle-Mirroring-
This work simulates the trajectory of a charged particle under the effect of magnetic field produced by circular rings. With the right set of input, it's possible to visuvalize a scaled version of particle mirroring, similar to the phenomena of electron mirroring due to Earth's dipole fields.
